# Move Scripting Systems Documentation
Moves in Heart Gold have 2 of their own bytecode scripting languages that correspond with certain pieces of code that would have to be repeated constantly across moves.  This is similar in function to the various scripting systems from Gen 3 as well.

Like Gen 3, there are move battle scripts and move animation scripts.  Also like Gen 3, the battle scripting language is also used for various other things--handling ability stat raises, handling leftovers' HP increase, setting the weather from the overworld, etc.  Most of these are in combination with assembly code that is spread throughout the battle system--the code checks for the Drizzle ability, then queues up a battle script that sets rain.  The code checks for the Frisk ability, then queues up a battle script that handles the message being displayed.  The code checks for Mold Breaker on switch in, then queues a battle script to actually display the message that the Pokémon is breaking the mold.

Within these battle scripts, there are 3 separate narc files that each are different in function, in order they will be covered:
- ``battle_move_seq``
- ``battle_eff_seq``
- ``battle_sub_seq``

Move animation scripts are often called within battle scripts to show something happening, be it the Pokémon sliding around or small particles coming up to show that the Pokémon is honing its claws.  In addition to this, every single move has its own animation that is played when the move is used.  There are two classes of these, and admittedly I'm not too sure when the latter is used, but they are dumped in this repo for completeness and future-proofing:
- ``move_anim``
- ``move_sub_anim``

A lot of what this documentation will deal with is the initial output of the script dumper from well over a year ago.  Many script command names are in progress.  Many fields hadn't (still haven't!) been identified properly as vars/battlers/etc. and are thus dumped as raw numbers.  ``printmessage`` in particular is all of common, fully known, and dumped such that all of its parameters are initially raw numbers.  It is not all that high a priority to revamp the initial dump such that it's perfectly readable, instead preferring to add new entries/revamp old ones as they become relevant.  The initial dump will be shown, then the "prettyified" version will be commented next to it--just a better-readable version that corresponds to the same thing/interpretation of the value.

## ``battle_move_seq`` - a000
Every single move has a script in this narc.  Very few moves actually have substance in their script in here, instead jumping to the current ``battle_eff_seq`` script corresponding to the move that was selected.  Adding new moves requires that a new script be added to this narc, else no script will be dumped when the game looks for a move to run and the game crashes.  The ``battle_eff_seq`` file index that is chosen is the same as the ``battleeffect`` field in the moves structure.

## ``battle_eff_seq`` - a030
The first two bytes of the file with the move's index in the move data narc correspond with the script that is run from the ``battle_eff_seq`` narc.  These often primarily just do setup and queue up a ``battle_sub_seq``, interestingly enough.  A notable exception is Judgment's ``battle_eff_seq`` script, which determines the type that Judgment is going to be when used.  Similarly, 

## ``battle_sub_seq`` - a001
These scripts are largely where the code that actually does effects are run.  So a move will run through its ``battle_move_seq``, which queues up a corresponding ``battle_eff_seq``, most of which finally queue up a ``battle_sub_seq`` that executes the effect.

## ``move_anim`` - a010
Every move has its own animation in this file, and they are performed by these scripts using the .SPA particle files from a029.  There is no simple editor for the .SPA files as of yet despite documentation existing, so we currently just steal them from the Gen 5 games and see if they work in Heart Gold well enough.  Most ``move_anim`` scripts just load a particle file (the .SPA handles most of the movement of said particle), place particles from the file, and play a sound.

## ``move_sub_anim`` - a061
I believe this is used intermittently for when an animation needs to happen and there isn't a move slot that has the animation already defined.  I haven't looked too much into this as of yet, but things like Thief's animation for stealing an item (as opposed to the attack animation) and Pokémon using an item to heal are probably in this narc.

# Battle Script Examples
I personally learn primarily by example.  A lot of what the beginning stages of battle script editing were in Gens 2 and 3 was mashing hexadecimal together and seeing what all worked--before there were any competent editors (and even for a while after there were, as people preferred pasting assembled hex into the rom directly for some reason).  A similar approach can be taken for this, identifying certain blocks that look like, when isolated, can be ported and placed wherever.

## Example 1 - Tackle
To start out, we can look at Tackle and how it works.  Tackle, with move index 33, uses ``armips/move/battle_move_seq/033.s`` as the script that it immediately executes:
```
a000_033:
    jumptocurmoveeffectscript
```
This is the script that is present for almost all moves.  Because of this, I will omit looking at ``battle_move_seq`` in future examples to save space--what you can take away is basically that the ``battle_eff_seq`` is what is the main script and that a ``battle_move_seq`` script needs to be present for the mvoe lest the game crashes.  Most moves just jump to the current move effect script.  Looking at the ``battleeffect`` field from its move data entry (see ``armips/data/moves.s``):
```
movedata MOVE_TACKLE
    battleeffect 0
    pss SPLIT_PHYSICAL
    basepower 40
...
```
With a ``battleeffect`` field of 0, the script jumps to ``battle_eff_seq`` script 0 (``armips/move/battle_eff_seq/000.s``).

This script is then the basic damage-dealing script with no bells or whistles:
```
a030_000:
    critcalc
    damagecalc
    endscript
```
No ``battle_sub_seq`` is run in this case because the effect completely handles it by itself.
```
critcalc
calculates the critical multiplier (set to 1 in the case that there isn't one)

damagecalc
the basic damage calculator.  called for all damaging moves, but will disable itself if a separate damage calc is detected

endscript
ends the script and hands exection back to the overall battle engine if nothing else is queued
```
From there, we can look at other simple cases:  moves that lower the target's stats.  We can look at two examples of this to determine the differences, and this also introduces another core concept in move scripts with the connection between ``battle_eff_seq`` and ``battle_sub_seq``.

## Example 2 - Tail Whip/Growl
Let's take a look at the battle scripts of Growl and Tail Whip:
```
movedata MOVE_TAIL_WHIP
    battleeffect 19
    pss SPLIT_STATUS
    basepower 0
...

movedata MOVE_GROWL
    battleeffect 18
    pss SPLIT_STATUS
    basepower 0
...
```
``armips/move/battle_eff_seq/019.s`` (Tail Whip):
```
a030_019:
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_ADD_STATUS1, 0x80000017
    endscript
```
``armips/move/battle_eff_seq/018.s`` (Growl):
```
a030_018:
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_ADD_STATUS1, 0x80000016
    endscript
```

These ``battle_eff_seq`` scripts are queuing up a ``battle_sub_seq`` script that is executed after the ``endscript`` command seen here.

This script also introduces the concept of battle variables.  Unlike overworld scripting variables, battle variables all have a specific purpose (as they are a way for the script commands to directly access and manipulate fields from the massive battle structure that is used in the code).
These variables are mostly manipulated through the ``changevar`` script command, which has 3 parameters:
```
changevar operator, var, value
perform math operations on "var" using "value"
- operator is the math operation done on the variable
- var is the variable to change
- value is the argument for the operator
```
A list of operators for use with ``changevar`` are in the Battle Script Command Reference at the end.

The variable ``VAR_ADD_STATUS1`` tells the engine code that there is still something to be done to a Pokémon on the field when it is nonzero.  The engine code then moves to interpret ``VAR_ADD_STATUS1`` to map it to another battle script with the move's effect described.

There are two parts to the value that it sets:  the first part in the most significant bits (the 0x80000000).  More on those later.  The rest of it is a way that the game grabs the desired subscript.

We can break down Tail Whip's script as such:
```
a030_019:
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_ADD_STATUS1, 0x80000000 | 23 // 0x17 = 23, hexadecimal to decimal
    endscript
```
The most significant bits are dedicated to determining which Pokémon on the field the effect should apply to.  0x80000000 signals to the code that the target is the Pokémon that the effect applies to, and 0x40000000 signals that the effect applies to the attacker.  There are a few more values as well, but those are the more important ones at the moment.  These have convenient defines in ``armips/include/battlescriptcmd.s`` that allow us to break this down further:
```
a030_019:
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_ADD_STATUS1, ADD_STATUS_DEFENDER | 23 // 0x17 = 23, hexadecimal to decimal
    endscript
```
Now we know that this battle script tells the game to apply a certain effect to the defender.

The ``23`` correlates to a ``battle_sub_seq`` script through the table ``move_effect_to_subscripts`` in ``src/moves.c``:
```c
u32 move_effect_to_subscripts[] =
{
// ...
    [ 22] =  12, // attack -1
    [ 23] =  12, // defense -1
    [ 24] =  12, // speed -1
// ...
};
```
Now ``battle_sub_seq`` script 12 (``armips/move/battle_sub_seq/012.s``) is responsible for every single stat adjustment in battles, just fed slightly different parameters.  The modularity makes it difficult to understand, and we may cover it more comprehensively later.  Just know off the bat that it is responsible for stat changes--it will come up later.

The big takeaway currently is that Growl, when treated similarly to Tail Whip:
```
a030_018:
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_ADD_STATUS1, ADD_STATUS_DEFENDER | 22 // 0x16 = 22 decimal
    endscript
```
That 22 gives the ``attack -1`` entry from ``move_effect_to_subscripts``, right above Tail Whip's ``defense -1``.

## Example 3 - Rain Dance
A sort of complicated ``battle_eff_seq`` script that goes into a simple ``battle_sub_seq`` script, Rain Dance:
```
movedata MOVE_RAIN_DANCE
    battleeffect 136
    pss SPLIT_STATUS
    basepower 0
...
```
``armips/move/battle_eff_seq/136.s``:
```
a030_136:
    if IF_MASK, VAR_FIELD_EFFECT, 0x3, _0094
    preparemessage 0x31F, 0x0, "NaN", "NaN", "NaN", "NaN", "NaN", "NaN"
    changevar VAR_OP_CLEARMASK, VAR_FIELD_EFFECT, 0x80FF
    changevar VAR_OP_SETMASK, VAR_FIELD_EFFECT, 0x1
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_WEATHER_TURNS, 0x5
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_ADD_STATUS2, 0x2000005D
    checkitemeffect 0x1, BATTLER_ATTACKER, 0x71, _0090
    getitempower BATTLER_ATTACKER, VAR_09
    changevar2 VAR_OP_ADD, VAR_WEATHER_TURNS, VAR_09
_0090:
    endscript
_0094:
    changevar VAR_OP_SETMASK, VAR_10, 0x40
    endscript
```
Here we are introduced to some control flow things that the script system supports as well as some new commands:
```
if operator, var, value, address
conditional flow command
- operator is the math operation done on the variable, see Battle Script Command Reference
- var is the variable with the value to test
- value is the argument for the operator, always a constant for if
- address is the destination that the script will jump to if the if operator returns true

preparemessage id, tag, battlers 1-6
prepares a message to be used by printpreparedmessage
- id is the message index in the narc a027 file 197
- tag determines the strings that are buffered in which order from the Pokémon on the field
- the battlers determine which battlers on the field to grab information to buffer strings from
  - the tag detemines how many battlers are specified--"NaN" signifies that no battler will be built from that parameter

printpreparedmessage
prints the message prepared by "preparemessage"

checkitemeffect checker, battler, effect, address
conditional flow command that is based on item effect
- when "checker" is true, checkitemeffect jumps to "address" if battler doesn't have the item with effect "effect"
  - if false, checkitemeffect jumps to "address" if the battler does have the item with effect "effect"
- battler is the battler to check against
- effect is the held item effect to compare to
- address is the address to jump to

getitempower battler, variable
grabs the item power field from the item data narc and puts it in variable
- battler is the battler that has the item to grab the item power from
- variable is the variable to store the item power in

changevar2 operator, destvar, srcvar
changevar except the constant is now a variable
- operator is the same as changevar
- destvar is a variable that may or may not hold a value already that will be changed
- srcvar is a variable that operator uses to complete its operation
```
DSPRE introduces a separation between what it calls "scripts" and "functions."  Those do not exist here at all, at least not how DSPRE handles what the game is actually doing.  Conditional execution is handled much similarly as in raw assembly:  there are a number of conditional branches that go to other areas, and identicality to the original script files was a goal of this system to prevent complications.

Now to break down what exactly is happening in the script.

The ``if`` at the beginning checks to make sure that the field effect variable doesn't already have the rain bits set.  If the rain bits are already set, then the script jumps to ``_0094`` where ``VAR_10``, which stores move results among other things, has its "move failed" bit set.  If the move does not fail, the script continues at the ``preparemessage`` immediately following.  The ``preparemessage`` takes its ``id`` as 0x31F (799), which according to ``data/text/197.txt`` is the line ``It started to rain!``  As there are no string buffers in this, there is nothing to buffer, so it takes a ``tag`` of ``0x0`` and just prepares that message to print.  The ``changevar`` that clears the mask ``0x80FF`` from the field effect variable is ensuring that all other weathers that are active at the time of using Rain Dance are dissipated.  The script then sets the rain bit, sets the turns to 5, and queues up a ``battle_sub_seq`` script.  The Damp Rock's item effect is checked for, and if the attacker doesn't have a Damp Rock (as the ``checker`` is ``0x1``), then the script ends and jumps to ``_0090``.  Otherwise, the ``VAR_WEATHER_TURNS`` has the item power field from the ``getitempower`` script command added to it.  VAR_09 is typically used as a (very) temporary variable--random number calculations are stored there on top of other calculation interim steps that are necessary, both in battle script usage as well as the battle engine.

The script queues up the ``0x5D (93)`` status effect in the var and says that the target is the temporary work battler (``0x200000000``).  Looking at ``move_effect_to_subscripts`` again...
```c
u32 move_effect_to_subscripts[] =
{
// ...
    [ 92] = 101,
    [ 93] = 103, // subscript 103 is the queued battle_sub_seq script
    [ 94] = 105,
// ...
};
```
This takes us down a rabbit trail (``armips/move/battle_sub_seq/103.s``):
```
a001_103:
    gotosubscript 57
    endscript
```
New command, but the name is pretty explanatory:
```
gotosubscript num
calls battle_sub_seq script "num".  returns to the caller after an endscript is reached
- num is the index of the ``battle_sub_seq`` script to jump to
```
Which ends at (``armips/move/battle_sub_seq/057.s``):
```
a001_057:
    printpreparedmessage
    waitmessage
    wait 0x1E
    endscript
```
Two new script commands:
```
wait time
pause script execution for "time" frames
- time is the amount of frames to pause for

waitmessage
pause script execution until current message is done printing.  not just done for messages, also used for various states that take up time that script execution needs to pause for (although not animations).
```
This script just prints the prepared message from the ``preparemessage`` command back in ``armips/move/battle_eff_seq/136.s``, waits for 30 frames, and ends the script.

The queued ``battle_sub_seq`` script, despite taking us through another ``battle_sub_seq`` script, is solely responsible for printing the message prepared in the ``battle_eff_seq`` script!  

There are a number of "optimizations" like this that are done for whatever reason.  In dissecting how even simple attacks like Rain Dance work, sometimes you end up down massive trails of redundancy that make things challenging to dissect sometimes.  It is alright to be confused!  But it is especially important that the control flow commands (if, goto, gotosubscript, etc.) are well understood.

## Example 4 - Metal Claw/Charge Beam
What about moves that raise a stat when attacking (or have a chance to)?  For that we can look to Metal Claw and Charge Beam:

```
movedata MOVE_METAL_CLAW
    battleeffect 139
    pss SPLIT_PHYSICAL
    basepower 50
...

movedata MOVE_CHARGE_BEAM
    battleeffect 276
    pss SPLIT_SPECIAL
    basepower 50
...
```
``armips/battle_eff_seq/139.s``:
```
a030_139:
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_ADD_STATUS2, 0x4000000F // ADD_STATUS_ATTACKER | 15
    critcalc
    damagecalc
    endscript
```
``armips/battle_eff_seq/276.s``:
```
a030_276:
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_ADD_STATUS2, 0x40000012 // ADD_STATUS_ATTACKER | 18
    critcalc
    damagecalc
    endscript
```
Making a damaging move that also raises a stat is almost exactly like mashing the two effect scripts together!  A damaging attack, with the 3 basic ``critcalc``/``damagecalc``/``endscript`` commands!  Note that since the ``changevar`` queues up a script, it makes sense that the damage still occurs before the stat raise despite it queuing before the other script commands that one would expect to do the damaging--the script it queues actually occurs after the ``endscript`` of this script.

Both this and Rain Dance used ``VAR_ADD_STATUS2`` instead of just ``VAR_ADD_STATUS1``.  While I am not 100% sure why, I believe it is because ``VAR_ADD_STATUS1`` queues up a script to do a primary effect, whereas ``VAR_ADD_STATUS2`` queues up a secondary effect script.  Regardless, we can look again to ``move_effect_to_subscripts`` to see which subscript is queued up:
```c
u32 move_effect_to_subscripts[] =
{
...
    [ 14] =  63,
    [ 15] =  12, // attack +1
    [ 16] =  12, // defense +1
    [ 17] =  12, // speed +1
    [ 18] =  12, // spatk +1
    [ 19] =  12, // spdef +1
...
};
```
As we can see, Metal Claw queues up an attack +1 while Charge Beam queues up a spatk +1.


## Example 5 - Curse/Ancient Power/Superpower
So how do moves that manipulate multiple stats work?  We can look at moves like Curse and then AncientPower for that case:
```
movedata MOVE_CURSE
    battleeffect 109
    pss SPLIT_STATUS
    basepower 0
...

movedata MOVE_ANCIENT_POWER
    battleeffect 140
    pss SPLIT_SPECIAL
    basepower 60
...
```
``armips/move/battle_eff_seq/109.s``:
```
a030_109:
    ifmonstat IF_EQUAL, BATTLER_ATTACKER, MON_DATA_TYPE_1, TYPE_GHOST, _0044
    ifmonstat IF_EQUAL, BATTLER_ATTACKER, MON_DATA_TYPE_2, TYPE_GHOST, _0044
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_ADD_STATUS1, 0x40000058 // ADD_STATUS_ATTACKER | 88
    endscript
_0044:
    if2 IF_NOTEQUAL, VAR_ATTACKER, 0x10, _0060
    cmd_D4 BATTLER_ATTACKER
_0060:
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_ADD_STATUS1, 0x20000059 // ADD_STATUS_WORK | 89
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_MOVE_EFFECT, 0x1
    endscript
```
``armips/move/battle_eff_seq/140.s``:
```
a030_140:
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_ADD_STATUS2, 0x40000022 // ADD_STATUS_ATTACKER | 34
    critcalc
    damagecalc
    endscript
```
First off, new script commands from the Curse battle script:
```
ifmonstat operator, battler, field, value, address
jump to "address" if the "battler"'s stat designated by "field" is related to "value" as determined by "operator"
- operator is the math operation done on the variable, enumerated in "if"
- battler is the pokémon to get data from
- field is the data to grab from.  see field enumerations in the ifmonstat documentation
- value is the value to check against, used in the operator calculations as they appear in "if"
- address is the location to jump to when the if is true

if2 operator, var1, var2, address
jump to "address" if "var1" is related to "var2" as determined by "operator"
- operator is the same as the "if" operators
- var1 is a var to compare
- var2 is another var to compare against
- address is the location to jump to when the if is true

cmd_D4 battler
not sure what this command does.
- battler is the battler to affect
```
As can be seen, Curse has a number of extra things that come into play because of the Ghost type check!  We will look at AncientPower first.
```c
u32 move_effect_to_subscripts[] =
{
...
    [ 33] =  93,
    [ 34] = 119, // ancient power battle_sub_seq script
    [ 35] = 115,
...
};
```
``armips/battle_sub_seq/119.s``:
```
a001_119:
    changevar VAR_OP_SETMASK, VAR_60, 0x80
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_34, 0xF // 15
    gotosubscript 12
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_34, 0x10 // 16
    gotosubscript 12
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_34, 0x11 // 17
    gotosubscript 12
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_34, 0x12 // 18
    gotosubscript 12
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_34, 0x13 // 19
    gotosubscript 12
    changevar VAR_OP_CLEARMASK, VAR_60, 0x2
    changevar VAR_OP_CLEARMASK, VAR_60, 0x80
    endscript
```
AncientPower raises all of the main 6 stats that can be raised when successful.  This is clear here: it jumps to ``battle_sub_seq`` script 12 a total of 5 times each with a different value in ``VAR_34``.  These values hopefully by now look a bit familiar:
```c
u32 move_effect_to_subscripts[] =
{
...
    [ 14] =  63,
    [ 15] =  12, // attack +1
    [ 16] =  12, // defense +1
    [ 17] =  12, // speed +1
    [ 18] =  12, // spatk +1
    [ 19] =  12, // spdef +1
    [ 20] =  12, // accuracy +1
...
};
```
So in order to manipulate multiple stats in a move, one just needs to call subscript 12 over and over with different values in ``VAR_34``.  This is further confirmed by Superpower:
```
movedata MOVE_SUPERPOWER
    battleeffect 182
    pss SPLIT_PHYSICAL
    basepower 120
...
```
``armips/move/battle_sub_seq/182.s``:
```
a030_182:
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_ADD_STATUS2, 0x60000025 // ADD_STATUS_ATTACKER | ADD_STATUS_WORK | 37
    critcalc
    damagecalc
    endscript
```
``move_effect_to_subscripts`` in ``src/moves.c``:
```c
u32 move_effect_to_subscripts[] =
{
...
    [ 36] = 130,
    [ 37] = 138, // superpower's battle_sub_seq script
    [ 38] = 147,
...
};
```
``armips/move/battle_sub_seq/138.s``:
```
a001_138:
    changevar VAR_OP_SETMASK, VAR_60, 0x80
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_34, 0x16 // 22
    gotosubscript 12
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_34, 0x17 // 23
    gotosubscript 12
    changevar VAR_OP_CLEARMASK, VAR_60, 0x2
    changevar VAR_OP_CLEARMASK, VAR_60, 0x80
    endscript
```
``move_effect_to_subscripts`` in ``src/moves.c``:
```c
u32 move_effect_to_subscripts[] =
{
...
    [ 21] =  12, // evasion +1
    [ 22] =  12, // attack -1
    [ 23] =  12, // defense -1
    [ 24] =  12, // speed -1
...
};
```
I am honestly not sure of what the masks that it sets are, but pretty sure one toggles animations (the ``0x80``) instead of having them replay for every stat gain.  The last one probably signals that everything is over and the stat gains are done with.

### Curse as a stat-changing move
Finally, we can look at the rest of Curse (battle script repasted here for convenience, ``armips/move/battle_eff_seq/109.s``):
<details>
<summary>a030_109 - Curse effect script (click to dropdown!)</summary>

```
a030_109:
    ifmonstat IF_EQUAL, BATTLER_ATTACKER, MON_DATA_TYPE_1, TYPE_GHOST, _0044 // if the pokémon is of type ghost, go to _0044

    endscript
```
</details>
I am not sure what setting the ``VAR_MOVE_EFFECT`` to ``0x1`` does here.  Perhaps it is done when showing that the move effect is changing somehow?  I suspect that it has something to do with Curse explicitly, as I can't seem to nail it down.

``armips/move/battle_eff_seq/140.s``:
```
a030_140:
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_ADD_STATUS2, 0x40000022 // ADD_STATUS_ATTACKER | 34
    critcalc
    damagecalc
    endscript
```
Checking the ``battle_sub_seq`` scripts that Curse queues up from its ``battle_eff_seq`` script:
```c
u32 move_effect_to_subscripts[] =
{
...
    [ 87] =  95,
    [ 88] =  96, // curse not ghost - what we are currently interested in
    [ 89] =  97, // curse ghost
    [ 90] = 126,
...
};
```
``armips/battle_sub_seq/096.s``
```
a001_096:
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_34, 0x18 // 24
    gotosubscript 12
    changevar VAR_OP_SETMASK, VAR_06, 0x4001
    changevar VAR_OP_SETMASK, VAR_60, 0x80
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_34, 0xF // 15
    gotosubscript 12
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_34, 0x10 // 16
    gotosubscript 12
    changevar VAR_OP_CLEARMASK, VAR_60, 0x2
    changevar VAR_OP_CLEARMASK, VAR_60, 0x80
    endscript
```
Looking back at those familiar numbers:
```c
u32 move_effect_to_subscripts[] =
{
...
    [ 15] =  12, // attack +1
    [ 16] =  12, // defense +1
    [ 17] =  12, // speed +1
...
    [ 23] =  12, // defense -1
    [ 24] =  12, // speed -1
...
};
```
We can see that the speed -1 is queued first, followed by the attack +1 and the speed +1.  We can further see that when switching from the negative stat boosts to the positive stat boosts, ``VAR_06`` is masked with ``0x4001``.  Furthermore, the animation plays twice--once for the decrease, and once again for the increase--we can tell because the ``VAR_60`` mask with ``0x80`` thus doesn't happen until after the speed decrease happens.

### Curse as a Ghost type
Now let's look at Curse as a Ghost type (``armips/battle_sub_seq/097.s``):
```
a001_097:
    if IF_MASK, VAR_10, 0x10000, _00D0
    checksubstitute BATTLER_DEFENDER, _00D0
    ifmonstat IF_MASK, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_STATUS_2, 0x10000000, _00D0

    changemondatabyvalue VAR_OP_SETMASK, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_STATUS_2, 0x10000000
    changemondatabyvar VAR_OP_GET_RESULT, BATTLER_ATTACKER, MON_DATA_MAX_HP, VAR_HP_TEMP
    changevar VAR_OP_MUL, VAR_HP_TEMP, -1
    damagediv VAR_HP_TEMP, 2
    changevar VAR_OP_SETMASK, VAR_06, 0x40
    changevar2 VAR_OP_SET, VAR_BATTLER_SOMETHING, VAR_ATTACKER
    gotosubscript 2
    printmessage 0x1A1, 0x9, 0x1, 0x2, "NaN", "NaN", "NaN", "NaN"
    waitmessage
    wait 0x1E
    endscript
_00D0:
    changevar VAR_OP_SETMASK, VAR_10, 0x40
    endscript
```
A few new script commands here:
```
changemondatabyvalue operator, battler, field, value
changes mon data "field" by "value" as specified by "operator"
- operator is the same as the "changevar" operators
- battler is the battler to grab the data from
- field is the data to grab/set from the battler
- value is the argument for the operator

changemondatabyvar operator, battler, field, var
changes mon data "field" by "var"'s value as specified by "operator"
- operator is the same as the "changevar" operators.  if looking to set the var to the mon data field, use VAR_OP_GET_RESULT
- battler is the battler to grab the data from
- field is the data to grab/set from the battler
- var is the variable the engine grabs from to manipulate the mon data field

damagediv var, value
sets damage to be "var" / "value"
- var is the numerator in the division
- value is the denominator in the division
```
If ``VAR_10`` has ``0x10000`` set, the script sets the move failed bit in ``VAR_10`` and ends the script.  Similar for the ``checksubstitute`` command, where if the ``BATTLER_DEFENDER`` has some status then the move fails and the script ends.  Finally, if the curse bit is set in the Pokémon's ``MON_DATA_STATUS_2`` field, then the move fails as well.  The move then calls ``battle_sub_seq`` script 76 (``armips/move/battle_sub_seq/076.s``):
```
a001_076:
    printattackmessage
    waitmessage
    playanimation BATTLER_ATTACKER
    waitmessage
    endscript
```
Two new very simple commands from this one:
```
printattackmessage
prints the current attack message from a027 file 003 (data/text/003.txt).

playanimation battler
plays the current attack's animation based on "battler"
- battler is the primary battler to base the animation on
```
This is a simple battle script that generically prints the attack message and plays the move animation before ending.

So at ``gotosubscript 76`` from the Curse subscript above, the attack name is printed and the animation played.  Repasting the Curse script:
```
a001_097:
...
    gotosubscript 76
    changemondatabyvalue VAR_OP_SETMASK, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_STATUS_2, 0x10000000
    changemondatabyvar VAR_OP_GET_RESULT, BATTLER_ATTACKER, MON_DATA_MAX_HP, VAR_HP_TEMP
    changevar VAR_OP_MUL, VAR_HP_TEMP, -1
    damagediv VAR_HP_TEMP, 2
    changevar VAR_OP_SETMASK, VAR_06, 0x40
    changevar2 VAR_OP_SET, VAR_BATTLER_SOMETHING, VAR_ATTACKER
    gotosubscript 2
    printmessage 0x1A1, 0x9, 0x1, 0x2, "NaN", "NaN", "NaN", "NaN"
    waitmessage
    wait 0x1E
    endscript
_00D0:
    changevar VAR_OP_SETMASK, VAR_10, 0x40
    endscript
```
The Curse bit is then set (you can think of this as the ``BATTLER_DEFENDER`` is inflicted with Curse by the ``changemondatabyvalue`` command there), and the ``BATTLER_ATTACKER``'s max HP is placed into ``VAR_HP_TEMP``.  ``VAR_HP_TEMP`` is made to be negative (by multiplying by -1), and the damage to be dealt is set to ``VAR_HP_TEMP / 2``--half of the max HP.  The bit in ``VAR_06`` is set to signal to subscript 2 that is coming up that the move sound effect should not be played, that the HP should just be manipulated (as we will see in a moment).  Finally, the ``VAR_BATTLER_SOMETHING`` is set to be ``VAR_ATTACKER``--the temporary work battler is set to be the attacker so that subscript 2, which is written to be generic, will know what to do.  We go to subscript 2 (``armips/move/battle_sub_seq/002.s``):
```
a001_002:
    if IF_MASK, VAR_06, 0x40, _0044
    playmovesoundeffect BATTLER_xFF
    monflicker 0xFF
    waitmessage
    if IF_EQUAL, VAR_69, 0x0, _0044
    gotosubscript 264
_0044:
    changevar VAR_OP_CLEARMASK, VAR_06, 0x40
    healthbarupdate BATTLER_xFF
    waitmessage
    datahpupdate BATTLER_xFF
    tryfaintmon BATTLER_xFF
    if IF_GREATER, VAR_HP_TEMP, 0x0, _0094
    changevar2 VAR_OP_SET, VAR_ASSURANCE_DAMAGE, VAR_HP_TEMP
_0094:
    endscript
```
Documenting more new script commands:
```
playmovesoundeffect battler
plays the move's damaging sound effect with pan based on "battler"
- battler is the basis of the sound pan

monflicker battler
makes "battler" flicker as if hit
- battler is the Pokémon to flicker

healthbarupdate battler
updates "battler"'s hp bar
- battler is the battler that has the hp bar to update

datahpupdate battler
updates the information on the "battler"'s hp bar, specifically the hp data
- battler is the owner of the hp data to update

tryfaintmon battler
tries to faint "battler".  nothing happens if fails, the mon will slide down otherwise
- battler is the mon to faint
```
So we can see that this is another generic subscript made to be used under many circumstances.  It deals damage and then does all the updating of the HP bars as necessary.  I will let you check out subscript 264 if you want, but it is not relevant to the current case, as ``VAR_06`` has its ``0x40`` bit set and the script jumps to ``_0044`` instead of executing all of that.  It is the script responsible for the super-effective weakening berries, and we may be looking at it as a specific use-case later where we want to add something like, say, the Roseli Berry.

Finally, back to the ``printmessage`` command from the Curse script:
```
a001_097:
...
    gotosubscript 2
    printmessage 0x1A1, 0x9, 0x1, 0x2, "NaN", "NaN", "NaN", "NaN"
    waitmessage
    wait 0x1E
    endscript
_00D0:
    changevar VAR_OP_SETMASK, VAR_10, 0x40
    endscript
```
This ``printmessage`` finally gets to a different ``tag`` (that isn't 0)!  Here, we can grab the ``tag`` value from the documentation at the bottom:
```c
#define TAG_TRNAME                      (8)     //trainername

#define TAG_NICK_NICK                   (9)     //nickname      nickname
#define TAG_NICK_MOVE                   (10)    //nickname      move
```
Here we see that there are two fields that it grabs, so it requires 2 of the 6 ``battler`` parameters.  The rest are left as "NaN" as before.  To understand what is going on, we check out line ``0x1A1 (417)`` from ``data/text/197.txt`` (with brackets added for ease of reference):
```
[417] {STRVAR_1 1, 0, 0} cut its own HP\nand laid a curse on {STRVAR_1 1, 1, 0}!
[418] {STRVAR_1 1, 0, 0} cut its own HP\nand laid a curse on the wild\f{STRVAR_1 1, 1, 0}!
[419] {STRVAR_1 1, 0, 0} cut its own HP\nand laid a curse on the foe’s\f{STRVAR_1 1, 1, 0}!
[420] The wild {STRVAR_1 1, 0, 0} cut its own HP\nand laid a curse on {STRVAR_1 1, 1, 0}!
[421] The wild {STRVAR_1 1, 0, 0} cut its own HP\nand laid a curse on the wild\f{STRVAR_1 1, 1, 0}!
[422] The foe’s {STRVAR_1 1, 0, 0} cut its own HP\nand laid a curse on {STRVAR_1 1, 1, 0}!
[423] The foe’s {STRVAR_1 1, 0, 0} cut its own HP\nand laid a curse on the foe’s\f{STRVAR_1 1, 1, 0}!
```
Here we are introduced to a way of doing things that is rather interesting and is very much a massive waste of space:  The only string variables used are for the nicknames directly.  Otherwise, the ``printmessage`` command will just add on for the correct circumstance to achieve a new message that correctly reflects the battle at hand.  Generally speaking, most moves that only buffer 1 battler from the field will have 3 messages, one for the player, the wild mon, and the foe's mon--this is even the case for the ``printattackmessage`` text archive, ``data/text/003.txt``.  In Curse's case, because one battler is using the move on another battler and both are buffered, there are 7 cases, all automatically adjusted for like the above.  It then takes two battlers, and the command looks somewhat better like this:
```
printmessage 417, TAG_NICK_NICK, BATTLER_ATTACKER, BATTLER_DEFENDER, "NaN", "NaN", "NaN", "NaN"
```
Meaning that the first ``{STRVAR_1 1, 0, 0}`` will be replaced with the nickname of the attacker, and the second ``{STRVAR_1 1, 1, 0}`` will be replaced with the nickname of the defender.  The script then ends after waiting for the message to print.

# Synthesizing new move effects
In adding a new move that doesn't have an effect that already exists, we need to add a new ``battle_eff_seq`` script.  In this repo, it's simply a matter of creating a new `.s` file in the folder.  As an example, I will be looking to implement Simple Beam--an effect that isn't currently done in the repo--as move effect 292 that will queue up subscript 330 to do its effect.  

## Adding Simple Beam's Effect
Simple Beam sets the defender's ability to Simple unless if the ability it would overwrite is any of Truant, Multitype, Stance Change, Schooling, Comatose, Shields Down, Disguise, RKS System, Battle Bond, Power Construct, Ice Face, Gulp Missile, or As One.  All of these checks can be done directly from the battle scripts themselves using ``ifmonstat`` and ``changemondatabyvalue``.

To start out, we can finally discuss the headers of each script file, which you'd see if you opened any of the files directly from the repo.  These will largely be the same for each scripts, with exceptions depending on if more constants are needed:
```
.nds
.thumb

.include "armips/include/battlescriptcmd.s"
.include "armips/include/abilities.s"
.include "armips/include/itemnums.s"
.include "armips/include/monnums.s"
.include "armips/include/movenums.s"
```
These are all directives that tell armips to either set things up differently or read separate files for defines and other asm if included.  The ``.nds`` directive configures the output to be little-endian and sets the assembler to output ARM 9 code in ARM mode.  The ``.thumb`` directive fixes the ARM mode output to be in thumb mode, which for ARM assembly code is a cut-down space-conserving instruction set.  The ``.include`` directive opens up the file specified by the filepath in the string, assembling said file similar to the ``#include`` directive from C.
```
.create "build/move/battle_eff_seq/0_001", 0
```
The ``.create`` directive tells armips to create the file at the filepath in the string and will start writing to it from the base offset 0.

Finally, each file ends with the ``.close`` directive to tell armips to close out of the file and make no further changes.

So we create a new file in ``armips/move/battle_eff_seq`` called ``292.s`` with the contents at the moment solely:
```
.nds
.thumb

.include "armips/include/battlescriptcmd.s"
.include "armips/include/abilities.s"
.include "armips/include/itemnums.s"
.include "armips/include/monnums.s"
.include "armips/include/movenums.s"

.create "build/move/battle_eff_seq/0_292", 0

simpleBeamScript: // a030_292
```
There is nothing that we can actually do from the ``battle_eff_seq`` that needs to be done for Simple Beam, which just gives the defender the Simple ability (instead of changing move damage or something like that that isn't battler-specific).  As a result, we just go straight to queuing up a ``battle_sub_seq`` and ending the script right away:
```
simpleBeamScript: // a030_292
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_ADD_STATUS1, ADD_STATUS_DEFENDER | xxx
    endscript
```
So now we know that we queue up a script that affects the defender.  What do we put in for ``xx``, the index of ``move_effect_to_subscripts``?  In this repo, you can actually just add on to the end of ``move_effect_to_subscripts`` in ``src/moves.c``.  So we add on a new entry to the end:
```c
u32 move_effect_to_subscripts[] =
{
...
    [152] = 318, // shell smash
    [153] = 319, // v create
    [154] = 320, // autotomize
    [155] = 330, // simple beam - new entry
};
```
Which makes the ``battle_eff_seq`` script:
```
simpleBeamScript: // a030_292
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_ADD_STATUS1, ADD_STATUS_DEFENDER | 155 // queue up simple beam subscript
    endscript
```
Now we look to make the Simple Beam subscript, adding a ``battle_sub_seq`` script to the end of the folder as ``330.s``:
```
.nds
.thumb

.include "armips/include/battlescriptcmd.s"
.include "armips/include/abilities.s"
.include "armips/include/itemnums.s"
.include "armips/include/monnums.s"
.include "armips/include/movenums.s"

.create "build/move/battle_sub_seq/1_330", 0

simpleBeamSubScript: // a001_330
```
Now to build the script.  We need to change the defender's ability to Simple.  We've covered a command to do so, ``changemondatabyvalue`` (which should be ``changemondatabyvalue``):
```
simpleBeamSubScript: // a001_330
    changemondatabyvalue VAR_OP_SET, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_ABILITY, ABILITY_SIMPLE // set the defender's ability to simple
    endscript
```
But now the animation just plays and the move ends with no indication of what happened.  From there, we need to print a message, for which we need to add a new message as well:
```
simpleBeamSubScript: // a001_330
    changemondatabyvalue VAR_OP_SET, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_ABILITY, ABILITY_SIMPLE // set the defender's ability to simple
    printmessage 1348, TAG_NICK_ABILITY, BATTLER_DEFENDER, BATTLER_DEFENDER, "NaN", "NaN", "NaN", "NaN"
    endscript
```
Adding the message to the ``197.txt``, just have to add as line 1348 (when the first line is zero, brackets added as reference and not actually inserted):
```
[1348] {STRVAR_1 1, 0, 0}’s ability\nchanged to {STRVAR_1 5, 1, 0}!
[1349] The wild {STRVAR_1 1, 0, 0}’s\nability changed to {STRVAR_1 5, 1, 0}!
[1350] The foe’s {STRVAR_1 1, 0, 0}’s\nability changed to {STRVAR_1 5, 1, 0}!
```
This text entry (specifically the string variables used) is based on Flash Fire's, at entry 656:
```
[656] {STRVAR_1 1, 0, 0}’s {STRVAR_1 5, 1, 0} raised\nthe power of its Fire-type moves!
[657] The wild {STRVAR_1 1, 0, 0}’s\n{STRVAR_1 5, 1, 0} raised the power\fof its Fire-type moves!
[658] The foe’s {STRVAR_1 1, 0, 0}’s\n{STRVAR_1 5, 1, 0} raised the power\fof its Fire-type moves!
```
Now we have Simple Beam, which replaces the defender's ability with Simple, printing a message that will look something like:
```
The foe's Elgyem's
ability changed to Simple!
```
Finally, we have to add that the move fails when the defender's ability is any number of abilities.  A move fails when ``VAR_10`` has its ``0x40`` bit set, as discussed previously:
```
moveFails:
    changevar VAR_OP_SETMASK, VAR_10, 0x40
    endscript
```
So now we add a check for the ability Truant that will jump to ``moveFails`` if the defender has the ability using ``ifmonstat``.
```
    ifmonstat IF_EQUAL, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_ABILITY, ABILITY_TRUANT, moveFails
```
Combining it all together:
```
simpleBeamSubScript: // a001_330
    ifmonstat IF_EQUAL, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_ABILITY, ABILITY_TRUANT, moveFails // move fails if the defender has truant

    changemondatabyvalue VAR_OP_SET, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_ABILITY, ABILITY_SIMPLE // set the defender's ability to simple
    printmessage 1348, TAG_NICK_ABILITY, BATTLER_DEFENDER, BATTLER_DEFENDER, "NaN", "NaN", "NaN", "NaN"
    endscript

moveFails:
    changevar VAR_OP_SETMASK, VAR_10, 0x40
    endscript
```
Now Simple Beam fails when it's used on a defender with Truant.  Adding the rest of the abilities:
```
simpleBeamSubScript: // a001_330
    ifmonstat IF_EQUAL, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_ABILITY, ABILITY_TRUANT, moveFails           // move fails if the defender has truant
    ifmonstat IF_EQUAL, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_ABILITY, ABILITY_MULTITYPE, moveFails        // move fails if the defender has multitype
    ifmonstat IF_EQUAL, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_ABILITY, ABILITY_STANCE_CHANGE, moveFails    // move fails if the defender has stance change
    ifmonstat IF_EQUAL, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_ABILITY, ABILITY_SCHOOLING, moveFails        // move fails if the defender has schooling
    ifmonstat IF_EQUAL, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_ABILITY, ABILITY_COMATOSE, moveFails         // move fails if the defender has comatose
    ifmonstat IF_EQUAL, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_ABILITY, ABILITY_SHIELDS_DOWN, moveFails     // move fails if the defender has shields down
    ifmonstat IF_EQUAL, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_ABILITY, ABILITY_DISGUISE, moveFails         // move fails if the defender has disguise
    ifmonstat IF_EQUAL, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_ABILITY, ABILITY_RKS_SYSTEM, moveFails       // move fails if the defender has rks system
    ifmonstat IF_EQUAL, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_ABILITY, ABILITY_BATTLE_BOND, moveFails      // move fails if the defender has battle bond
    ifmonstat IF_EQUAL, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_ABILITY, ABILITY_POWER_CONSTRUCT, moveFails  // move fails if the defender has power construct
    ifmonstat IF_EQUAL, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_ABILITY, ABILITY_ICE_FACE, moveFails         // move fails if the defender has ice face
    ifmonstat IF_EQUAL, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_ABILITY, ABILITY_GULP_MISSILE, moveFails     // move fails if the defender has gulp missile
    ifmonstat IF_EQUAL, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_ABILITY, ABILITY_AS_ONE, moveFails           // move fails if the defender has as one

    changemondatabyvalue VAR_OP_SET, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_ABILITY, ABILITY_SIMPLE // set the defender's ability to simple
    printmessage 1348, TAG_NICK_ABILITY, BATTLER_DEFENDER, BATTLER_DEFENDER, "NaN", "NaN", "NaN", "NaN"
    endscript

moveFails:
    changevar VAR_OP_SETMASK, VAR_10, 0x40
    endscript
```
That should be all needed to do the effect for Simple Beam!  For future examples, I will be skipping the header creation for simplicity--just know that it will be there.

To recap:  Add a new ``battle_eff_seq`` script that queues up a ``battle_sub_seq`` script, add a new entry to ``move_effect_to_subscripts`` in ``src/moves.c`` that corresponds to the one you queued up in the ``battle_eff_seq`` script, and then add a new ``battle_sub_seq`` that corresponds to the entry you just added to ``move_effect_to_subscripts`` that then performs all of the effects.

## Adding Fairy Type Handling to Judgment
Old moves are also updatable in hg-engine--a few that have been are Rapid Spin and Judgment.  Let's look at what Judgment does to see how we can add Fairy type handling to it, quick look back at ``armips/data/moves.s``:
```
movedata MOVE_JUDGMENT
    battleeffect 268
    pss SPLIT_SPECIAL
    basepower 100
```
So we look at ``battle_eff_seq`` script 268 (``armips/move/battle_eff_seq/268.s``) (the old version [here](https://github.com/BluRosie/hg-engine/blob/7180691503c90a80ff184802d069f299584013d4/armips/move/battle_eff_seq/268.s)):

While long, it should be clear what it is doing:  with the ``checker`` of ``checkitemeffect`` being ``0x0`` for each command, the commands are all checking to see if the ``BATTLER_ATTACKER`` has an item with that item effect.  A quick detour into the item data shows that each of these move effects belong directly to a plate--you can see another breakdown [here](https://github.com/BluRosie/hgss-filesys-example/blob/fairy-type/asm/fairy.s#L18-L41), where I modify one of the many ASM places that dictate how Arceus gets its type to include the Fairy type.

We can label this a bit better to show what is happening:

With all of the type values labeled and the labels themselves having the names, this script looks even clearer.  Adding a new held item effect that turns Judgment into a Fairy type move should just be following the pattern, adding something like this:

```
a030_268:
...
    checkitemeffect 0x0, BATTLER_ATTACKER, XXXX, _setFairy      // TYPE_FAIRY
...
_setFairy:
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_MOVE_TYPE, TYPE_FIRE
    goto _return
...
```

And if you're not replacing an old item for the Pixie Plate, then the ``XXXX`` becomes a brand new item effect slot.  The game ends at ``0x92``, so we use ``0x93``:
```
a030_268:
...
    checkitemeffect 0x0, BATTLER_ATTACKER, 0x93, _setFairy      // TYPE_FAIRY
...
_setFairy:
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_MOVE_TYPE, TYPE_FAIRY
    goto _return
...
```
This is actually the method used directly in hg-engine for updating Judgment:

## Adding Fairy Type Reduction Berry
Gen 4 introduced all of the berries that activate when a super-effective move is used against the holder.  The damage they take is then halved as a result, making them very frequent in competitive play as a result, with every turn being important in the overall scheme of battles.  As mentioned previously when covering Curse as a Ghost type, the type-halving berries are covered in ``battle_sub_seq`` script 264, a generic script that actually has that as its primary purpose--check if the damage being done should be halved by the berries or not.

The script dump as it originally appears is as follows, taken from [here](https://github.com/BluRosie/hg-engine/blob/7180691503c90a80ff184802d069f299584013d4/armips/move/battle_sub_seq/264.s):

A few new commands from this:
```
abilitycheck checker, battler, ability, destination
jump to "destination" if "battler" has or doesn't have "ability" based on "checker"--if "checker" is 0, jumps if the "battler" has the "ability", otherwise jump if doesn't have "ability"
- checker determines to check if "battler" has or doesn't have "ability"--if "checker" is 0, jumps if the "battler" has the "ability", otherwise jump if doesn't have "ability"
- battler is the battler whose ability to check
- ability is the ability to check for
- destination is where to jump if the check succeeds

setstatus2effect battler, value
sets status2 "value" bits for "battler" (condition2 in the BattlePokemon structure)
- battler is the battler to grab status2 from
- value comprises the bits to set in status2

getmoveparameter field
grabs parameter "field" from the move data structure and stores in VAR_09
- "field" is the data to grab from the move, enumerations in the documentation

getitemeffect battler, var
grabs the item held effect from "battler" and puts it in "var"
- battler is the battler to grab the item held effect from
- var is the var to store the item held effect in

removeitem battler
removes the item from battler
- battler is the battler whose item to remove

So a few things that we can gather from this is the difference between how this is programmed and how the Judgment plates are programmed.  Instead of using many different ``checkitemeffect`` commands for each individual berry, this script stores the item effect in a variable and performs many comparisons on that variable.  This demonstrates a sort of flexibility present in the scripting system: you can do any of multiple things to accomplish the same goal.  You can even rewrite this to be the same as the other one (or vice versa!).  The important part is testing everything out before leaving it be and tracking issues as they pop up.

Looking at the script again, the pattern for each type becomes clear again, and thus a way to expand it to include Fairy type with the snippet:
```
a001_264:
...
_checkBerries:
...
    if IF_EQUAL, VAR_43, XXXX, _checkFairy
...
_checkFairy:
    if IF_EQUAL, VAR_09, TYPE_FAIRY, _halveDamage
    goto _endScript
...
```
Once again, we need to replace ``XXXX`` with a held item effect.  The Pixie Plate (as added last section) had held effect ``0x93``, so if we aren't replacing another item to implement the Roseli Berry's effect, then we just add onto that by using ``0x94``.  Otherwise can just use the held item effect of the item that you are replacing.
```
a001_264:
...
_checkBerries:
...
    if IF_EQUAL, VAR_43, 0x94, _checkFairy
...
_checkFairy:
    if IF_EQUAL, VAR_09, TYPE_FAIRY, _halveDamage
    goto _endScript
...
```
And finally, the script in which Fairy is spaced out to make clear that it was added there:

## Making a New Stat-Raising Move
Various new moves have stat-raising capabilities that have yet to exist in Gen 4.  Quiver Dance and Hone Claws both come to mind as moves that have unimplemented combos of stats to change, with Hone Claws raising Attack and Accuracy and Quiver Dance raising all of Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed.

This section will go about implementing those moves using new ``battle_eff_seq`` and ``battle_sub_seq`` scripts while adding a few new entries to ``move_effect_to_subscripts``.  Everything that is needed to do this has been covered above--now it is a matter of implementing it.  Specifically, hg-engine has already done Quiver Dance, but rehashing how it was done will be important.

We start with a new ``battle_eff_seq`` that queues up a ``battle_sub_seq`` once again.  In hg-engine, Quiver Dance's effect is 283, so we add it as that:
```
a030_283:
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_ADD_STATUS1, ADD_STATUS_ATTACKER | ADD_STATUS_QUIVER_DANCE
    endscript
```
Here, we see that a ``battle_sub_seq`` script queued up through ``VAR_ADD_STATUS1`` that supposedly is ``ADD_STATUS_QUIVER_DANCE``--we define new ``ADD_STATUS`` constants as they appear at the top of ``armips/include/battlescriptcmd.s``.  This even further clarifies the purpose of the script, so that when we're looking back at what we did and see an ``ADD_STATUS_QUIVER_DANCE`` instead of ``148`` we know better what to do.  Ideally, new scripts don't have to use any sort of numbers at all!  We can define whatever constants whenever we need them.

Adding the new entry to ``move_effect_to_subscripts``:
```c
u32 move_effect_to_subscripts[] =
{
...
    [146] = 312, // guard split
    [147] = 313, // power split
    [148] = 314, // quiver dance - new entry
};
```
Seeing that the last ``battle_sub_seq`` used was 313, we can move to map ``ADD_STATUS_QUIVER_DANCE`` to ``battle_sub_seq`` script 314, a new one.

Finally, we can move to make the ``battle_sub_seq`` script, looking at Curse as a non-ghost type as reference:
```
a001_096: // script for Curse as a non-ghost type
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_34, 0x18 // 24
    gotosubscript 12
    changevar VAR_OP_SETMASK, VAR_06, 0x4001
    changevar VAR_OP_SETMASK, VAR_60, 0x80
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_34, 0xF // 15
    gotosubscript 12
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_34, 0x10 // 16
    gotosubscript 12
    changevar VAR_OP_CLEARMASK, VAR_60, 0x2
    changevar VAR_OP_CLEARMASK, VAR_60, 0x80
    endscript
```
As we did before, we can look at ``move_effect_to_subscripts`` and remember what is going on here:
```c
u32 move_effect_to_subscripts[] =
{
...
    [ 15] =  12, // attack +1 // curse queues this up
    [ 16] =  12, // defense +1 // curse queues this up
    [ 17] =  12, // speed +1
    [ 18] =  12, // spatk +1
    [ 19] =  12, // spdef +1
    [ 20] =  12, // accuracy +1
    [ 21] =  12, // evasion +1
    [ 22] =  12, // attack -1
    [ 23] =  12, // defense -1
    [ 24] =  12, // speed -1 // curse queues this up
    [ 25] =  12, // spatk -1
    [ 26] =  12, // spdef -1
    [ 27] =  12, // accuracy -1
    [ 28] =  12, // evasion -1
...
};
```
We can see that Curse queues up speed -1, attack +1 and defense +1 between the bitmasks that it does the ``VAR_60`` with ``gotosubscript 12`` commands, showing that the Pokémon is having its Speed lowered and Attack and Defense increased when Curse occurs.

So we look to make one that raises Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed:
```
a001_314:
    changevar VAR_OP_SETMASK, VAR_60, 0x80
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_34, 18 // spatk +1 (see move_effect_to_subscripts)
    gotosubscript 12
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_34, 19 // spdef +1
    gotosubscript 12
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_34, 17 // speed +1
    gotosubscript 12
    changevar VAR_OP_CLEARMASK, VAR_60, 0x2
    changevar VAR_OP_CLEARMASK, VAR_60, 0x80
    endscript
```
And thus the Quiver Dance script is done.  The ``statbuffchange`` command from ``battle_sub_seq`` script 12 handles ensuring that all the stats raised don't overflow or anything, failing if they do.

## Making a Move that Sets Attacker to Random Typing
Here we are looking to add some randomness to our battle script to determine the effect that happens.  For this, we can use the ``random`` battle script command:
```
random range, start
chooses a random number between "start" and "start"+"range" inclusive, storing it in VAR_09
- range is the range of numbers above "start" to choose from
- start is the beginning of the random numbers to choose from
```
The goal is to set the attacker's typing to a random type that isn't the one it already has.  We make a new ``battle_eff_seq`` that queues up a new ``battle_sub_seq`` script applying to the attacker (with ``ADD_STATUS_ATTACKER``) to set the player's type to something in and of itself.  We skip the ``battle_eff_seq`` script and move to the ``battle_sub_seq``, as this ``battle_eff_seq`` is similar to the rest of them.
```
setType:
    changemondatabyvalue VAR_OP_SET, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_TYPE_1, TYPE_WATER
    changemondatabyvalue VAR_OP_SET, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_TYPE_2, TYPE_WATER
    endscript
```
This script sets the Pokémon's type to be monotype water.  There is no indication that it happens--it just happens, and the animation of the move plays.  We add a message to print as well as a jump to subscript 76 so that the animation and all plays in order:
```
setType:
    changemondatabyvalue VAR_OP_SET, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_TYPE_1, TYPE_WATER
    changemondatabyvalue VAR_OP_SET, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_TYPE_2, TYPE_WATER
    gotosubscript 76
    printmessage 178, TAG_NICK_TYPE, BATTLER_ATTACKER, BATTLER_WORK, "NaN", "NaN", "NaN", "NaN" // {STRVAR_1 1, 0, 0} transformed\ninto the {STRVAR_1 15, 1, 0} type!
    waitmessage
    wait 0x1E
    endscript
```
We can directly change the type to Water this way and even use the Conversion battle message for it (from ``armips/move/battle_sub_seq/045.s``).  When the type changes in-game, however, the new type fails to buffer correctly.  For this, we turn to a new variable:  ``VAR_22``.  ``VAR_22`` is the temporary message buffer variable, and it determines many indices that the script system uses to buffer words into string variables.  When using ``TAG_NICK_TYPE``, the ``printmessage`` command first buffers the nickname of the Pokémon that is specified by the first ``battler`` parameter.  Then the type name is buffered using the value in ``VAR_22`` directly.

Changing the script to buffer the Water type properly:
```
setType:
    changemondatabyvalue VAR_OP_SET, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_TYPE_1, TYPE_WATER
    changemondatabyvalue VAR_OP_SET, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_TYPE_2, TYPE_WATER
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_22, TYPE_WATER
    gotosubscript 76
    printmessage 178, TAG_NICK_TYPE, BATTLER_ATTACKER, BATTLER_WORK, "NaN", "NaN", "NaN", "NaN" // {STRVAR_1 1, 0, 0} transformed\ninto the {STRVAR_1 15, 1, 0} type!
    waitmessage
    wait 0x1E
    endscript
```
Now we need to make sure that the move just fails if the user is already Water-type (but only if both types are water--the move will work on Water/Poison mons, for example):
```
setType:
    ifmonstat IF_NOT_EQUAL, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_TYPE_1, TYPE_WATER, moveWorks
    ifmonstat IF_EQUAL, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_TYPE_2, TYPE_WATER, moveFails

moveWorks:
    changemondatabyvalue VAR_OP_SET, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_TYPE_1, TYPE_WATER
    changemondatabyvalue VAR_OP_SET, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_TYPE_2, TYPE_WATER
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_22, TYPE_WATER
    gotosubscript 76
    printmessage 178, TAG_NICK_TYPE, BATTLER_ATTACKER, BATTLER_WORK, "NaN", "NaN", "NaN", "NaN" // {STRVAR_1 1, 0, 0} transformed\ninto the {STRVAR_1 15, 1, 0} type!
    waitmessage
    wait 0x1E
    endscript

moveFails:
    changevar VAR_OP_SETMASK, VAR_10, 0x40
    endscript
```
Here, we add 2 ``ifmonstat`` checks to see if the types are both Water or not.  Note that the second one only ever runs if the first one is successful--i.e. if the script execution falls through to ``moveWorks`` (without the jump from the first ``ifmonstat``) then the first Pokémon's type is Water, but the second is different--which still qualifies for what we want to do with it.

Now we need to generate a random type and adjust all of these checks to be against another variable instead of against a constant.  ``ifmonstat`` becomes ``ifmonstat2``, ``changemondatabyvalue`` becomes ``changemondatabyvar``, ``changevar`` becomes ``changevar2``.  A quick documentation addition:
```
ifmonstat2 operator, battler, field, variable, address
ifmonstat except variable-based
jump to "address" if the "battler"'s stat designated by "field" is related to "variable" as determined by "operator"
- operator is the same as the "if" operators
- battler is the pokémon to get data from
- field is the data to grab from.  enumerations below
- variable is the variable to check against, used in the operator calculations as they appear in "if"
- address is the location to jump to when the if is true
```
```
setRandomType:
    random NUM_OF_TYPES-1, 0 // generate random number from 0 - (NUM_OF_TYPES - 1) inclusive, store it in VAR_09
    if IF_EQUAL, VAR_09, TYPE_MYSTERY, setRandomType // if fairy type hasn't been introduced as type 9, need to check for it here and regenerate a type if necessary

    ifmonstat2 IF_NOT_EQUAL, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_TYPE_1, VAR_09, moveWorks
    ifmonstat2 IF_EQUAL, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_TYPE_2, VAR_09, moveFails

moveWorks:
    changemondatabyvar VAR_OP_SET, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_TYPE_1, VAR_09
    changemondatabyvar VAR_OP_SET, BATTLER_DEFENDER, MON_DATA_TYPE_2, VAR_09
    changevar2 VAR_OP_SET, VAR_22, VAR_09
    gotosubscript 76
    printmessage 178, TAG_NICK_TYPE, BATTLER_ATTACKER, BATTLER_WORK, "NaN", "NaN", "NaN", "NaN" // {STRVAR_1 1, 0, 0} transformed\ninto the {STRVAR_1 15, 1, 0} type!
    waitmessage
    wait 0x1E
    endscript

moveFails:
    changevar VAR_OP_SETMASK, VAR_10, 0x40
    endscript
```

# Adding Completely New Script Commands
*Warning!*  C code ahead.  If you are not comfortable with reading/generating code, this will be inaccessible for you.

Once in a while you need access to some functionality that absolutely can not be done via battle scripts.  Main examples of this will be new battle effects like Wide Guard blocking only certain moves, the Pledge moves interacting, and Autotomize reducing the weight of the Pokémon.

This section will cover specifically adding new script commands with a few examples.  hg-engine has made this relatively easy compared to the base game, with the only need being expanding a table with a new entry & new code that details that entry.

Old script commands end at ``0xE0`` with ``endscript``.  To maintain compatibility with vanilla scripts, we just add on to those, starting with ``0xE1`` and counting up from there.  Instead of repointing the whole table, there is an expanded table and the vanilla table.  The vanilla table is still in overlay 12 and left untouched, but when new command is parsed the handler hands it off to the new table instead.  Examining the code in ``src/battle_script_commands.c``, we can see:
```c
BOOL BattleScriptCommandHandler(void *bw, struct BattleStruct *sp)
{
    BOOL ret;
    u32 command;

    do {
        command = sp->SkillSeqWork[sp->skill_seq_no];

        if (command < START_OF_NEW_BTL_SCR_CMDS) // command is < E1
        {
            ret = BattleScriptCmdTable[command](bw, sp);
        }
        else
        {
            ret = NewBattleScriptCmdTable[command - START_OF_NEW_BTL_SCR_CMDS](bw, sp);
        }

    } while ((sp->battle_progress_flag == 0) && ((BattleTypeGet(bw) & BATTLE_TYPE_WIRELESS) == 0));

    sp->battle_progress_flag = 0;

    return ret;
}
```
This then leaves a brand new ``NewBattleScriptCmdTable[]`` for us to populate:
```c
const btl_scr_cmd_func NewBattleScriptCmdTable[] =
{
    
};
```
First, we need to write our new code.  New script commands as C functions must have the declaration:
```c
BOOL function (void *, struct BattleStruct *);
```
While the first ``void *`` parameter is actually a structure that we rarely have to enumerate in the code that we edit (hence its ``void`` typing), the ``BattleStruct`` structure gives just about all the information that we want in the battle at any given time.

## First New Command - 0xE1 ``reduceweight``
Our battle script command will be called ``reduceweight`` and will take one parameter--the amount by which to reduce the weight.  We add the function elsewhere in the ``battle_script_commands.c`` file:
```c
BOOL btl_scr_cmd_E1_reduceweight(void *bw, struct BattleStruct *sp)
{
    IncrementBattleScriptPtr(sp, 1);

    return FALSE;
}
```
All battle script commands call ``IncrementBattleScriptPtr``, passing the ``BattleStruct`` and ``1`` to increment the inustruction and return ``FALSE``.  This would be the equivalent of a ``nop`` or ``dummy`` battle script command--one that does nothing and just advances the script.

As previously mentioned, the ``BattleStruct`` keeps track of just about everything to do with battles.  Much of it is still labeled as it appears in the leaked source in ``include/battle.h`` with many modifications as the fields are documented and used in this repo.

In looking to reduce the weight, we can see that weight is tracked per-Pokémon directly in the ``BattlePokemon`` structure nested in the overall ``BattleStruct`` structure.

So we add something to read the weight delta to the function and subtract it from the Pokémon:
```c
BOOL btl_scr_cmd_E1_reduceweight(void *bw, struct BattleStruct *sp)
{
    s32 delta;
    
    IncrementBattleScriptPtr(sp, 1);
    delta = read_battle_script_param(sp); // read the parameter in from the battle script, incrementing the battle script ptr again

    sp->battlemon[sp->attack_client].weight -= delta; // reduce the attacker's weight by the read parameter

    return FALSE;
}
```
Finally, we need to add error checking to make sure the weight doesn't decrease below 1:
```c
BOOL btl_scr_cmd_E1_reduceweight(void *bw, struct BattleStruct *sp)
{
    s32 delta;
    
    IncrementBattleScriptPtr(sp, 1);
    delta = read_battle_script_param(sp);

    if (delta >= sp->battlemon[sp->attack_client].weight) // if the weight would decrease below 1
        sp->battlemon[sp->attack_client].weight = 1; // minimum weight is 0.1 kg
    else
        sp->battlemon[sp->attack_client].weight -= delta;

    return FALSE;
}
```
Finally, to make the new script usable, add it to the ``NewBattleScriptCmdTable``:
```c
const btl_scr_cmd_func NewBattleScriptCmdTable[] =
{
    [0xE1 - START_OF_NEW_BTL_SCR_CMDS] = btl_scr_cmd_E1_reduceweight,
};
```
Finally, we need to add a script macro to ``armips/include/battlescriptcmd.s`` at the end of the file with a blurb as to what it does:
```arm
// reduce attacker weight in hectograms (increments of 0.1 kg) (num can be positive or negative, negative actually increases the weight)
.macro reduceweight,num
    .word 0xE1
    .word num
.endmacro
```
We can finally make a ``battle_sub_seq`` for Autotomize, having already gone through the whole process of making a ``battle_eff_seq`` as well and such:
```
// autotomize move effect

a001_320:
    ifmonstat IF_EQUAL, BATTLER_ADDL_EFFECT, MON_DATA_STAT_STAGE_SPEED, 12, NoStatusEffect

    gotosubscript 76
    changevar VAR_OP_SETMASK, VAR_06, 0x200000
    changevar VAR_OP_SETMASK, VAR_06, 0x4001
    changevar VAR_OP_SETMASK, VAR_60, 0x80
    changevar VAR_OP_SET, VAR_34, 41 // speed +2
    gotosubscript 12
    changevar VAR_OP_CLEARMASK, VAR_60, 0x2
    changevar VAR_OP_CLEARMASK, VAR_60, 0x80
    reduceweight 1000 // weight reduced by 100.0 kg
    endscript
NoStatusEffect:
    printattackmessage
    waitmessage
    wait 0x1E
    printmessage 0x300, 0x2, 0x7, "NaN", "NaN", "NaN", "NaN", "NaN" // {STRVAR_1 1, 0, 0}’s stats won’t\ngo any higher!
    waitmessage
    wait 0x1E
    changevar VAR_OP_SETMASK, VAR_10, 0x80000000
    endscript
```

## Script Command 0xE2 - ``heavyslamdamagecalc``
Here we make a damage calculator for the move Heavy Slam specifically.  It compares the ratio of the user's weight to the target's weight and writes the base power based on that.  The lower the target's weight compared to the attacker's weight, the more damage the move does.

The code, showing exactly that happen, at the end of ``src/battle_script_commands.c`` (as well as a declaration at the beginning):
```c
BOOL btl_scr_cmd_E2_heavyslamdamagecalc(void *bw, struct BattleStruct *sp)
{
    u32 ratio;

    IncrementBattleScriptPtr(sp, 1);

    // grab the ratio of defense weight/attack weight as a % to 2 decimal places
    ratio = (sp->battlemon[sp->defence_client].weight * 1000) / sp->battlemon[sp->attack_client].weight;

    if (ratio <= 2000)      // < 20.00%
        sp->damage_power = 120;
    else if (ratio <= 2500) // 20.01% - 25.00%
        sp->damage_power = 100;
    else if (ratio <= 3334) // 25.01% - 33.34%
        sp->damage_power = 80;
    else if (ratio <= 5000) // 33.35% - 50.00%
        sp->damage_power = 60;
    else                    // > 50.01%
        sp->damage_power = 40;

    return FALSE;
}
```
Now we need to add the new command to the new battle script instructions table:
```c
const btl_scr_cmd_func NewBattleScriptCmdTable[] =
{
    [0xE1 - START_OF_NEW_BTL_SCR_CMDS] = btl_scr_cmd_E1_reduceweight,
    [0xE2 - START_OF_NEW_BTL_SCR_CMDS] = btl_scr_cmd_E2_heavyslamdamagecalc,
};
```
Finally, add a battle script macro for the command to ``armips/include/battlescriptcmd.s``:
```
.macro heavyslamdamagecalc
    .word 0xE2
.endmacro
```
The command in action from usage in a battle script, specifically just the ``battle_eff_seq`` script.  This doesn't even require a subscript!  Based on the one for Gyro Ball (``armips/move/battle_eff_seq/219.s``):
```
HeavySlamEffectScript:
    heavyslamdamagecalc
    critcalc
    damagecalc
    endscript
```
